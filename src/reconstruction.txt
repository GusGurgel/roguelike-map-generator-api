Gutrixa is not a place, but the interior of a colossal, corrupted organism known as Zha'thik. The environment is a suffocating labyrinth of living tissue, where the walls pulse with bioluminescent light and the air is thick with noxious mists and the stench of decay. The journey begins at the Entrance, a narrow tunnel of fleshy, blue-green walls slick with digestive fluids, where the silence is broken only by the gurgle of fluids and the creaking of biological structures. As Lyra, the twisted cultist seeking redemption, delves deeper, the surroundings become increasingly hostile and surreal.

The path leads through the Caverns of Corruption, a vast space filled with gravity-defying organic formations and eerie, flickering tendrils. Here, the ground is uneven and hazardous, and the mournful screams of the damned echo in the distance. This gives way to the Shifting Tunnels, a claustrophobic nightmare where the walls secrete acid that eats away at equipment and the floor constantly changes texture and elevation, disorienting the traveler. The atmosphere thickens in the Misty Depths, a dark chamber shrouded in a blinding fog where the slick ground betrays every step, hiding the approach of nightmarish creatures.

The ecosystem within Gutrixa is a grotesque parody of life. Twisted horrors like the Flesh Borer and the Zhathik Titan roam the corridors, while the shadows hide stealthy predators like the Gutrixa Scurrier. The air is filled with the buzzing of Zhathik Drones and the terrifying presence of The Devourer's minions. To survive, Lyra must wield weapons forged from the very body of the beast—daggers of bone and sinew, swords grown from the walls, and staves channeling bioluminescent energy. The descent culminates in the Heart of Corruption, a realm of absolute biological madness where the walls are twisted tissue and the floor is a shifting mass of corruption. At the center lies the Echokernel, a pulsating crystalline heart surrounded by a halo of tendrils, the source of the dark energy that must be extracted to halt the spread of The Devourer's influence.
