Backstory & Motivation: Once bound by loyalty to the pirate queen, the character was betrayed and left for dead in the depths of the Drowned Maw. The fungal spores fused with his flesh, granting eerie powers but a relentless curse that whispers the ghostly shanty of Mara. Driven by a desperate need for redemption and a burning desire to either break the fungal curse or harness its power to claim the cavern as his own pirate empire, he returns to the Maw armed with stolen maps and a vendetta. Visuals: He wears a tattered tricorn hat stained with bioluminescent slime, a leather coat patched with rusted iron plates that pulse faint teal where the fungus has seeped into his skin. His left arm is a twisted wooden prosthetic entwined with living vines that glow softly. He wields a rusted cutlass whose blade is etched with sigils that flicker with fungal light, and a flintlock pistol that fires phosphorescent shot.
