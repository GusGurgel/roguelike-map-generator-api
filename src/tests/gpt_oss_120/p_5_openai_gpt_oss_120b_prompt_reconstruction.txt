Backstory & Motivation: While studying the ancient ruins on the surface of the Maw\u2011Titan, he uncovered a fragment of a lost transmission warning that the Acidic Mycelium will soon breach the Corrosive Core, threatening to spill the Titan's digestive cauldron into the void. Driven by a blend of redemption for his reckless research and a desperate need to save the scattered remnants of the extinct civilization, he volunteers to infiltrate the ever\u2011shifting stomach\u2011city and purge the mycelial infestation. Visuals: He wears a skin\u2011tight exo\u2011suit of iridescent chitin\u2011reinforced plates, each segment etched with glowing glyphs that mimic the creature's own bioluminescence. His eyes are replaced by a pair of soft amber lenses that flicker with diagnostic readouts, and a network of translucent nanofiber tendrils protrudes from his forearms, ready to interface with the living architecture or slice through hostile bio\u2011constructs.", "tile_with_texture": {"name": "bio_mech_scout", "description": "A slender, bioluminescent scout clad in adaptive organo\u2011metal armor, its chassis pulsing with faint green veins that echo the living walls of the Maw", "color": "#2E8B57", "texture": {"tileset_position": {"x": 29, "y": 9}, "tileset_description": "A creature with different armor.

Legends tell that the heart once pulsed pure regenerative energy, the very power the ancient civilization tried to bind to heal their world.

Leaving the heart in the depths would let the Mycelium continue to corrupt the Titan, eventually turning the entire organism into a wandering acid\u2011filled leviathan that could devour entire star systems.
