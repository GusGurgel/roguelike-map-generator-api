Over centuries the spell has frayed, allowing the Maw\u2019s corruption to seep through cracks, turning water into a living menace and mind\u2011twisting fog into a living nightmare.\n\nThe core itself is the source of that corruption: a living crystal that feeds on the life force of the drowned, growing brighter as the Maw\u2019s influence spreads. If left unchecked, the core will eventually break free, flooding the world with its malevolent tide. The only way to stop or harness the Maw is to retrieve the core and either re\u2011seal it with a new binding spell or use its power to command the abyss.\n\nThus the player must descend to the very bottom of the cove, confront the Maw\u2019s twisted minions, and carry the Black Maw Core back to the entrance. Only by doing so can the player decide the fate of the cove\u2014seal the Maw once more, or wield its dark power to claim dominion over the abyss.", "tile_with_texture": {"name": "black_maw_core", "description": "A pulsating, obsidian crystal pulsing with bioluminescent veins, its surface rippling like living water.
