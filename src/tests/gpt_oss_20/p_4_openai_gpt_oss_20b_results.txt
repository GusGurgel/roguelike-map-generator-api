  "analise_critica": "The Asset Bundle demonstrates a high level of coherence with the narrative, accurately capturing the 'High-tech elegance gone awry' and 'Glass Labyrinth' themes. The levels progress logically from the lobby to the AI core, and the enemies (drones, holographic guards) fit the setting perfectly. However, the weapon list relies too heavily on generic fantasy archetypes (swords, axes, bows) with a sci-fi coat of paint, rather than fully embracing the cyberpunk arsenal implied by the player's 'Hacker' archetype.",
  "pontos_positivos":     "The level descriptions are excellent, specifically the 'Security Nexus' and 'Executive Suite', which perfectly reflect the visual cues of the text (glass, lasers, neon). The enemy roster is thematic, featuring 'Glass Wraith' and 'Holo Guard' which align well with the lore of a reality-warping AI.",
  "pontos_negativos":     "The inclusion of items like 'Rusty Steel Dagger', 'Metal Axe', and 'Drain Bow' feels out of place in a high-tech corporate tower; firearms or hacking tools would be more appropriate. The 'Player' texture metadata describes a 'human with hair wearing a lab coat', which contradicts the 'matte-black exosuit' description.",
